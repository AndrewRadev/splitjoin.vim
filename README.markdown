## Usage

This plugin is meant to simplify a task I've found too common in my workflow:
switching between a single-line statement and a multi-line one.

I usually work with ruby and a lot of expressions can be written very concisely
on a single line. A good example is the "if" statement:

``` ruby
puts "foo" if bar?
```

This is a great feature of the language, but when you need to add more
statements to the body of the "if", you need to rewrite it:

``` ruby
if bar?
  puts "foo"
  puts "baz"
end
```

The idea of this plugin is to introduce a single key binding for transforming a
line like this:

``` html
<div id="foo">bar</div>
```

Into this:

``` html
<div id="foo">
  bar
</div>
```

And another binding for the opposite transformation.

This currently works for:
  * Various constructs in Ruby and Eruby
  * Various constructs in Coffeescript
  * Various constructs in Perl
  * Various constructs in Python
  * PHP arrays
  * Javascript object literals and functions
  * Tags in HTML/XML
  * CSS, SCSS, LESS style declarations.
  * YAML arrays and maps
  * Lua functions and tables
  * Go structs
  * Vimscript line continuations
  * TeX blocks
  * C if clauses and function calls

For more information, try `:help splitjoin`, or take a look at the help file
online at
[doc/splitjoin.txt](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/splitjoin.vim/blob/master/doc/splitjoin.txt)

For more examples and corner cases, you can explore the "examples" directory
here:

It's not present in the downloadable zip file to avoid cluttering your vimfiles
with useless stuff.
